        m_Untranslated: "The Unity Scene View is like a playground where you build
          your game! Imagine you're setting up a world with characters, objects,
          and even puzzles. The Scene View is where you get to arrange and design
          how everything looks and works in your game.\n\n<b>Here's how it works</b>\n\n-
          <b>Building Blocks:</b> Think of the Scene View as a space where you can
          place all your toys and building blocks. You can move them around, turn
          them, and put them exactly where you want them to be. It's like creating
          your very own game playground!\n\n- <b>Top-Down and 3D View:</b> Just like
          how you can look at your toys from different angles\u2014from above, from
          the side, or all around\u2014the Scene View lets you see your game world
          in 3D. You can spin it around to make sure everything looks perfect.\n\n-
          <b>Magic Tools:</b> There are special tools in Unity to help you build
          your game world:\n   - <b>Move Tool:</b> It lets you pick up a toy and
          put it somewhere else.\n   - <b>Rotate Tool:</b> This tool helps you turn
          your toys to face different directions.\n   - <b>Scale Tool:</b> With this,
          you can make your toys bigger or smaller, just the way you like.\n\n- <b>Game
          Objects:</b> Everything in the Scene View is called a \"Game Object.\"
          These can be anything like trees, characters, cars, or even treasure chests.
          You place these objects in your scene to make your game come alive.\n\n-
          <b>Creating Your World:</b> The Scene View is where you design the levels
          or stages of your game. It\u2019s like being the director of a movie\u2014you
          decide what the players will see and where the action happens.\n\n<b>Why
          It's Cool:</b>\n- <b>Imagination:</b> The Scene View lets you turn your
          ideas into real game worlds, where you can create anything you can imagine.\n-
          <b>Interactive:</b> You can see your changes instantly while designing
          the scene, so it\u2019s like creating and playing at the same time.\n-
          <b>Exploring:</b> It\u2019s like playing with LEGO blocks or action figures,
          but inside a computer game where you have endless possibilities.\n\nThe
          Unity Scene View is your creative space where you can make your game worlds
          come to life. It's where the magic happens!\n\n"
