        m_Untranslated: "In Unity is like a list that shows everything in your game
          world. Imagine you\u2019re setting up a play area with toys, and you make
          a list of all the toys you\u2019ve placed so you don\u2019t forget where
          they are. The Scene Hierarchy is that list, keeping track of all the items
          you have in your game scene.\n\n- <b>The Cast of Your Game:</b> The Scene
          Hierarchy is like the cast list of a play or a movie. It shows you every
          character, prop, background, and object that appears in your game world.
          It helps you keep track of who\u2019s in the scene and where they are.\n\n-
          <b>Organizing Your Toys:</b> Just like you might set up your action figures
          in a certain order when you\u2019re playing, the Scene Hierarchy arranges
          everything in a neat list. It shows you all the pieces in your scene from
          top to bottom, so you always know what\u2019s in your game.\n\n- <b>Parent
          and Child Objects:</b> Some objects in the Scene Hierarchy can be grouped
          together like a family. The main object is called the \"parent,\" and all
          the items connected to it are called \"children.\" For example, a car might
          be the parent, and its wheels could be the children. If you move the car
          (parent), the wheels (children) move with it!\n\n- <b>Finding Your Game
          Pieces:</b> When you want to change or move something in your scene, you
          can quickly find it in the Scene Hierarchy. It\u2019s like looking at your
          list of toys to see exactly where your favorite action figure is so you
          can pick it up and play with it.\n\n- <b>Building Blocks:</b> The Scene
          Hierarchy is where you can easily add, delete, or rearrange the blocks
          that make up your game. It\u2019s like building with LEGO bricks, where
          you can take pieces out or add new ones anytime you want!\n\nThe Scene
          Hierarchy is your game's master list, keeping track of all the pieces in
          your world and making sure they\u2019re in the right place so your game
          can run smoothly!\n\n"
