        m_Untranslated: "<b>The Unity Game View</b> is like the screen where you
          play and test your game! Imagine you're testing a video game you made,
          and you want to see exactly what it looks like when someone else plays
          it. The Game View shows you how your game will appear when it\u2019s ready
          to play.\n\n<b>Let's make it fun and easy to understand:</b>\n\n- <b>Play
          the Game:</b> The Game View is where you press the \"play\" button to see
          your game in action. It's like turning on your gaming console and seeing
          your game characters move and do what you programmed them to do.\n\n- <b>Player\u2019s
          View:</b> This view shows you the game from the player\u2019s perspective.
          So, whatever the player will see when they play your game, that\u2019s
          what you see in the Game View. It's like looking through the eyes of your
          character!\n\n- <b>Test Your Game:</b> The Game View is perfect for testing
          your game. You can try out your levels, see if the characters jump correctly,
          check if the enemies move the way you want, and find out if your game is
          fun to play!\n\n- <b>Fixing Bugs:</b> If something doesn\u2019t work right
          in your game, you can go back to the Scene View to fix it and then return
          to the Game View to see if you\u2019ve made it better. It's like making
          sure your toy car\u2019s wheels roll smoothly before showing it to your
          friends.\n\n- <b>Full-Screen Fun:</b> You can make the Game View full screen
          to get the real feel of playing your game, just like you would on your
          computer, phone, or console.\n\n<b>Why It\u2019s Awesome:</b>\n- <b>Instant
          Feedback:</b> The Game View shows you right away how your game is working,
          so you know what to change or keep.\n- <b>Just Like Real:</b> It\u2019s
          the place where your game comes to life and starts to look like a real
          game that people can play.\n- <b>Experiment and Play:</b> You get to try
          out your ideas, make changes, and have fun watching your game grow step
          by step!\n\nThe Unity Game View is where you get to see your game come
          alive and test out all the cool things you\u2019ve created. It\u2019s like
          the big screen where your game becomes a reality!\n"
